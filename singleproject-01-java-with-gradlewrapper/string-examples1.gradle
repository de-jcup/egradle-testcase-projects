// Single quotes:
def s1 = 'Yep this is a string, and we can use "double quotes" without escaping them.'
def m1 = '''With three quotes
we can write multi-line strings, without all
the hassle of concatenation.'''
 
// Double quotes:
def s2 = "Also a string, and of course we can use 'single quotes' without escaping them."
def m2 = """\
With three double quotes we can have a multi-line string,
and we don't need to add extra + signs. Very easy for
copy-paste."""
 
// Slashy (also multi-line possible):
def s3 = /Well almost everything goes in a "slashy" 'string' without escaping. Good for readable regular expressions!/
 
// Dollar slashy:
def s4 = $/
Like a 'slashy' string, but with different escaping rules
for slashes ("/")
/$
